# Searchlight - IMINT

## Overview
This room explores the discipline of IMINT/GEOINT (Image Intelligence and Geospatial Intelligence). It is designed for those who are beginning their OSINT journey or are new to IMINT/GEOINT.  

Throughout the room, you will learn how to:  
- Develop the right analytical mindset  
- Extract key visual data from images and videos  
- Apply different tools to assist with geolocation and contextual analysis  

By the end of the room, you should feel comfortable using tools and methodologies to geolocate images and answer context-based questions using visual intelligence alone. This challenge is a solid foundation for more advanced CTFs and real-world geolocation tasks.

## Your first geolocation challenge!

To obtain the flag in this case, the task was straightforward. I was given an image and had to discover where it was taken. It was very obvious because there was a street sign clearly visible in the center of the image.

## Just Google it!

### Challenge Questions
1. Which city is the tube station located in?
2. Which tube station do these stairs lead to?
3. How many platforms are there in this station?
4. Which year did this station open?

I could answer the first one immediately because the signs in the image are typical of the location.

> Note: If you google the text on the sign, you will also find the city.

When you google the text from the sign, the first result shows the station with its name in the title. Once you know the name, it is trivial to answer the remaining questions.

> Note: You could also use reverse image search.

## Keep at it!

### Challenge Questions
1. Which building is this photo taken in?
2. Which country is this building located in?
3. Which city is this building located in?

To solve this question, I searched for the text visible at the top of the image: **YVR CONNECTS**.  
Once the building name was found, its location was easy to obtain through a simple Google search.

## Coffee and a light lunch

### Challenge Questions
1. Which city is this coffee shop located in?
2. Which street is this coffee shop located on?
3. What is their phone number?
4. What is their email address?
5. What is the surname of the owners?

To answer these questions, I first searched for the *Edinburgh Woollen Mill* visible across the street. After finding it on Google Maps, it was easy to identify the coffee shop.  
The phone number appeared directly on Google, the email address was available on the business’s Facebook page, and the owners’ surnames were found on one of the business listing sites.

## Reverse your thinking

### Challenge Questions
1. Which restaurant was this picture taken at?
2. What is the name of the Bon Appétit editor that worked 24 hours at this restaurant?

Using reverse image search, I found the restaurant name. After that, I looked for the restaurant’s nickname.  
By searching for the restaurant name along with *Bon Appétit*, I found the relevant article and the editor’s name.

## Locate this sculpture

### Challenge Questions
1. What is the name of this statue?
2. Who took this image?

This question can be solved using reverse image search.  
After finding the statue name and city, I located a website that maps outdoor sculptures in the area. This page included the same image and credited the photographer.

## ...and justice for all

### Challenge Questions
1. What is the name of the character that the statue depicts?
2. Where is this statue located?
3. What is the name of the building opposite this statue?

Reverse image search reveals the character’s name.  
Searching for the character name along with the word *statue* shows several results. One of them matched the image from a different angle and included the location in the caption.  
By locating the statue in Google Maps, I identified the building directly in front of it.

## The view from my hotel room

For this challenge, a video was provided, but there was no option to download it.

### Challenge Questions
1. What is the name of the hotel that my friend stayed in a few years ago?

The video showed a view of Singapore with several easily identifiable landmarks. By using two of them as reference points (the Riverside Point area and a building with the word *Central*), I was able to triangulate the approximate location of the hotel.
